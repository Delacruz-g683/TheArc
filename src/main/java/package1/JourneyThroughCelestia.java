//Jesse Hiebner Story Code here.
//Progression as follows:
/*
* 20/05/2022 -> Brainstorming what to write for story and getting updated on what entities I should help or do
* 21/05/2022 -> Coding Player class, Superweapon class(including weapon bare hands, weapon bow and arrow, weapon knife),JourneyThroughCelestia class for Brandon and Jesse's game.
